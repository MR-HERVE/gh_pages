           The group before used to perform play,excluding Mordecai who joined them later.Their journey
           was not a walk in the park for they sometimes had to sleep while travelling especially when they
           had to perform far places with minimum wages.
          They sang a political song during an election period in 2013,where people asked the bands`name but they 
          had not figured that out.Their first interview was done by Caroline Mutoko from kiss Fm of their songs
          "uliza kiatu"was a bit hit at the time.
